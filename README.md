# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
The first thing you have to do is unzip the file. Then look in the website folder and open the index.html file. Also you can look at the app.js and server.js files along with the style.css file. The index.html file will give you an idea of the front-end aspects of this project. You will then have to use the terminal and run the server.js file. This will give you the back-end aspects of the project. When you have the index.html file and server.js files both opened and run respectively you are ready to begin. While server.js is being run fill out the form fields with the appropriate answers (zipcode and feelings) then scroll down to the bottom of the page and you should see an output for the date, temp, and feelings in an additional text area. The app.js file also provides you with necessary data to complete the project.
